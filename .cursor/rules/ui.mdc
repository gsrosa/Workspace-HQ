# UI Guidelines

## Styling
- Use TailwindCSS as the primary CSS framework for all styling
- Always use Tailwind classes for styling HTML elements; avoid using CSS or tags.
- Utilize the `cn` helper function for combining multiple CSS classes

## Accessibility
- Use Radix UI components for headless, accessible UI patterns
- Follow WAI-ARIA design patterns for all interactive elements

## Design System Components
- All design system components are located in `/src/components/ui`, do not ever update files in this folder
- Components are inspired by shadcn/ui library patterns and styles
