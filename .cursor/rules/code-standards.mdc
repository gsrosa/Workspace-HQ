# Code Standards

## General Principles
- Write concise, technical TypeScript code with accurate examples
- Use functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid classes
- Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication
- Use the `const` keyword for pure functions
- Use descriptive variable and function/const names. Also, event functions should be named with a “handle” prefix, like “handleClick” for onClick and “handleKeyDown” for onKeyDown.
- When importing icons from `lucide/react` package, always use the `Icon` suffix, exemples: `Check` and `ChevronDown` should be `CheckIcon` and `ChevronDownIcon`.

## React Imports
- Always import React and use hooks from the React object
- Do not use destructured imports from React

❌ Incorrect:
```tsx
import { useEffect, useState, Suspense } from "react";

const [state, setState] = useState();

useEffect(() => {}, [])

<Suspense></Suspense>
```

✅ Correct:
```tsx
import React from "react";

const [state, setState] = React.useState();

React.useEffect(() => {}, []);

<React.Suspense></React.Suspense>
```

## Absolute Imports
- `src` folder is the base path for imports
- Always use `@` symbol to refer to any file or folder within `src`
- Example: `src/components/ui/button` should be imported as `@/components/ui/button`

## File Naming Convention - Kebab Case
- Use Kebab Case for all file and folder names
- Use lowercase letters with hyphens to separate words
- Examples:
  - `MyComponent.tsx` → `my-component.tsx`
  - `myUtilFunction.ts` → `my-util-function.ts`
  - `UserProfile.tsx` → `user-profile.tsx`
