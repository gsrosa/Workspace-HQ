# Project Structure

## Overview
The project follows a modular approach with most code residing in the `src` folder. The structure is organized to promote maintainability and clear separation of concerns.

## Root Structure
```sh
src
|
+-- @types            # Shared type declarations across the entire application
|
+-- components        # Shared components used throughout the application
|
+-- constants         # Shared constant values used throughout the application
|
+-- features          # Feature-based modules
|
+-- hooks             # Shared hooks used throughout the application
|
+-- lib               # Re-exporting different libraries preconfigured for the application
|
+-- app               # Tanstack Router pages associated with a route based on the file name
|
+-- styles            # Global styles and application theme
|
+-- utils             # Shared utility functions
```

## Feature-Based Architecture
Most code is organized inside the `features` folder, which contains domain-specific code for each feature. Every feature folder should follow this structure:

```sh
src/features/my-feature
|
+-- components  # Components related to the specific feature
|
+-- constants   # Shared constant values related to the specific feature
|
+-- hooks       # Hooks related to the specific feature
|
+-- shared      # Shared types (models and validation schemas) and constants across the feature
|
+-- store       # React contexts, zustand stores or any state management related to the specific feature
|
+-- index.ts    # Entry point for the feature, serving as the public API
```

## Import Patterns
- Always import from the feature's index.ts file (the public API)
- Never import directly from subdirectories within features

✅ Correct:
```ts
import { MyComponent } from "@/features/my-feature";
```

❌ Incorrect:
```ts
import { MyComponent } from "@/features/my-feature/components/my-component";
```

## Feature Public API
- Each feature must export all public items through its `index.ts` file
- The `index.ts` serves as the feature's public API
- This ensures clean imports and proper encapsulation
