## Script with Timestamps

### 0:00-0:15 - Landing Page & Overview

**Visual**: Show landing page, scroll through features

**Narration**: 
> "WorkspaceHQ is a modern workspace management platform built to demonstrate senior frontend engineering skills. Let me show you the key features."

### 0:15-0:30 - Signup/Login Flow

**Visual**: Navigate to signup, fill form, submit, show onboarding

**Narration**:
> "I'll sign up with a new account. The app uses Auth.js with credentials provider. Notice the form validation and smooth transitions."

### 0:30-0:50 - Create Organization

**Visual**: Create new organization, show org switcher

**Narration**:
> "After signup, I create a new organization. The app uses tRPC for type-safe API calls. The org switcher uses Radix UI for accessibility."

### 0:50-1:10 - RBAC & Invite Flow

**Visual**: Show users page, generate invite, demonstrate role restrictions

**Narration**:

**Visual**: Show code structure, Storybook, or dashboard

**Narration**:
